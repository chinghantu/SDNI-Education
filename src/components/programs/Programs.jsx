            <b>2020 – SDNI Nano Summer Institute for Teachers (Nano-SUIT) & Research Education for Teachers (RET)</b>
            <br /><br />
            The Nano-SUIT program combines the classic RET hands-on research experience for teachers with a comprehensive series of seminars in the broad field of nanotechnology. At the end of the program, participants produce a lesson plan, based on their research experience or another nanotechnology topic of their chsgce, that they must bring back to their respective schools/colleges for implementation in their class as well as sharing with their peers. This program hence acts as a catalyst for the “The California NanoTech 2025 Project”, which ultimately aims to integrate nanotechnology contents with the current school and college science curricula/programs across California. Please take note that each participant will be matched with an appropriate SDNI professor-mentor for the entire 6 weeks of the program, and the seminars will be provided by Dr. Yves Theriault, SDNI Director of Education Programs and Outreach as well as Dr. Ryan Nicholl, Microfabrication Engineer and SEM manager.
					<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Dates:</b> June 15, 2020 - July 24, 2020 with Final Presentations on July 31, 2020.

        <p>
            <br />
            (1) To ensure that quality nanotechnology contents is integrated to the K-12 NGSS-aligned current and future science curricula in every school district across California by year 2025.
					<br /><br />
            (2) The Project intends to help California community colleges to establish general nanotechnology programs aligned with 4- years university programs for efficient transfer as well as technical education programs aiming to develop hands-on nanofabrication skills that the current and future job market demand.

            <br />
            <b>Our outreach strategy consists of:</b>
            <br /><br />
            Creating awareness about nanotechnology at all level of the education system, from administrators and science specialists of offices of education and school districts, school principals, teachers and TOSAs, and ultimately reach the students. This awareness will be realized via presentations, seminars, in-person meeting, web meetings, webinars to the parties to be reached. One of the great engagement tools that SDNI has used so far consists of remote access to its high-end Scanning Electron Microscope whereby students and teachers can remotely control SDNI SEM (with Focus and Zoom functions) and observe specimen at the micro and nano scale.
					<br /><br />
            Creating nanotechnology contents that can be integrated to the current K-12 science curricula. Such contents is/will be distributed in the form of Open Educational Resources in electronic format for affordable and efficient distribution. This step in essential for a sustainable program aiming to make nanotechnology a part of the pre-college students’ education and a possible career chsgce.

            <br /><br />
            Some community colleges have nanotechnology classes and are well led by pioneers such as Jared Ashcroft at the Pasadena City College. However, most community colleges do not have such nanotechnology program and the majority of students attending these colleges do not know about nanotechnology or they heard about it as a buzz word only.
					<br /><br />
            <span className="programs-span"><b>(2) Options: General Program or Technical Education.</b></span>
            <br /><br />
            The authorization of new courses at community college is a lengthy process that takes approximately 2 years. Consequently, the establishment of standalone general nanotechnology program (in view of accredited transfer to a 4-year college) will take some time. However, the process should start now. We suggest starting the authorization process immediately based on 2 of the fundamental nano-engineering courses that are currently provided at UCSD and will be credited to any community college student desirous of transferring to UCSD. Upon successful enrollment and course completion, more classes can be added and eventually a full 2-year program can be established.
					<br /><br />
            These programs can aim general education such as nanochemistry, nanoengineering and the like in view of <b>transferring to a 4-year university or technical education</b> such as nanofabrication leading directly to the marketplace.
					<br /><br />
            <span className="programs-span"><b>(3) SDNI Outreach Strategy.</b></span>
            SDNI has established a partnership with Southwestern College (SWC) aiming to pilot the gradual development of a nanotechnology program at SWC. SDNI also intends to approach Miramar College, San Diego City College, and Mesa College located in the greater San Diego area and involve these 3 additional colleges in the pilot program. A successful implementation of pilot programs at these institutions, will pave the way to the implementation of nanotechnology programs across California based on lessons learned and success stories.

            Notice: Classes are limited to 15 students and enrollment is on a first arrive first serve basis. In order to qualify for a free training, you <b>must be enrolled in a STEM program in a California Community College or 4-year University</b>. Proof of enrollment will be needed prior to start of class.
                                <br /><br />
            If you are interested in any of the trainings, please email Yves Theriault, PhD, PMP at <b>ytheriault@ucsd.edu</b> and provide the following information: <b>Name, College attended, Major/Program, proof of enrollment, expected date of graduation</b>.

            <span className="programs-span"><b>1. Systems Engineering Fundamentals</b></span>
            <br /><br />
            Attendees are introduced to the fundamental principles of systems engineering and learn how to start from customer’s requirements elicitation to gradually define solution-unbiased systems requirements which ultimately lead to the definition of the system architecture and design with optimized engineering requirements. Students practice the drawing of context diagrams and the building functional lists and functional block diagrams of real-life man-made systems and establish appropriate system specifications and associated requirement traceability matrix. The training also covers the integration of specialty engineering disciplines and the basics of test and evaluation, quality assurance and control, as well as total life cycle management.

            <br /><br />
            Students are introduced to the model of the Learning Organization and its importance in fostering leadership which is the most important quality for anyone desirous of motivating, managing, leading teams in any organization, especially research and innovation-driven institutions. The training covers important related topics such as emotional intelligence, personality types, organizational culture and shared vision. Several examples of exemplary leadership are provided along with survey data that reports how people value true leaders and the characteristics and qualities that they seek from those leaders. Whether you are looking to perform in an academic or industrial setup, leadership skills are MUST HAVE if you are interested in leading people to achieve a shared vision. Finally, student s learn that leadership is not a born-child gift, but a set of skills that can be learned through practice, dedication, and hard work.

This program enables you to control the Zoom and Focus functions of our SEM from the comfort of your classroom. The only thing you need is a connection to the internet and a display screen (or LCD; you can also simply use your computer screen if nothing else is available). We have conducted several remote SEM sessions and all teachers and students have found this experience very engaging and eye opening. The observation of specimens at the micro and nano scale provide student with a unique knowledge tool that has proven to change the way students think about science.
					<br /><br />
            In order to schedule a remote SEM session, please go to the “Get Involved” tab and select the subtab: “Bring Nano Vision to Your School!” and fill the form. We will get back to you within 24 hours.

				<h3><b><br>DIRECTOR</b></h3>
				<p>
					<b><span style="color:#2D96FF"><br>Yves Theriault, PhD, PMP, Director of Education Programs and Outreach</span></b>
					<br><br>
					Yves obtained his PhD in Chemistry from University of Montreal in 1989 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Scripps Research Institute from 1989 to 1991 where he worked on the determination of three- dimensional structures of proteins by NMR spectroscopy.
					<br><br>
					Following his postdoc, Yves performed rational drug design at Abbott Laboratories for 2 years where he solved the 3-dimensional solution structure of the cyclophilin-cyclosporin complex which remains to date the most challenging structure ever solved by NMR. He then came back to California where he was involved in the startup of Ontogen Corporation, a combinatorial chemistry biotech, funded by Amgen. He then founded Jouvence Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego based biotech that focused on genomics of aging and regenerative medicine (1995-1998). He then consulted with a broad range of companies with a focus on performance management (1998-2009).
					<br><br>
					In 2009, Yves founded the California Institute for Performance Management (CALIPM), a non-for-profit educational organization, providing continued education in the fields of Leadership, Drug Development, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Systems Engineering, Project, Program, and Portfolio Management. He also created a tutoring component within CALIPM, The California Institute for Academic Excellence, and helped several students to obtain and maintain A grades and be admitted to the colleges of their choice. In the process, he learned about the California K-12 education system.
					<br><br>
					He currently is Director of Education Program and Outreach at the San Diego Nanotechnology Infrastructure (SDNI), located at UC San Diego. Yves brings to SDNI his knowledge of the California Education system and his extensive professional and academic background and knowledge of Science & Technology, Leadership, and Organizational Performance. SDNI is actively involved in bringing nanotechnology contents that can be integrated to current California high school and community college STEM curricula.
					<br><br>
					Yves is a certified Project Management Professional and an Active member of the International Council On System Engineering (INCOSE). He also has been Instructor at UCSD Extension since 2008 where he developed and taught courses in the fields of Leadership in the scientific/research environment, Drug Development, Medicinal Chemistry, and Biotech/Pharma Projec Management.
					<h3><b><br>DIRECTOR</b></h3>
					<b><span style="color:#2D96FF"><br>Oscar Vazquez Mena, Faculty Advisor</span></b>
					<br><br>
					Oscar obtained his Master of Science, majoring in Nanoscale Science and Engineering form Chalmers University of Technology in 2003 and his PhD degree in Microtechnolgy from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne in 2010.He was a postdoctoral fellow in the Physics Department at UC Berkley from 2011 to 2015 and in 2015 was postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) at Barcelona, Spain. Since 2016 he has held the position of Assistant Professor of Nanoengineering at UC San Diego.
					<br><br>
					Oscar is recipient of several awards to include DARPA Young Faculty Award (2018); UC San Diego Cesar Chavez Faculty Award for Community Work (2018); Marie Sklodowska-Curie EU Fellowship (2015); Swiss National Science Foundation Fellowship (2012-2014); Huygens Scholarship (The Netherlands, 2002-2003; and the STINT Fellowship (Sweden, 2000-2001).
					<br><br>
					Oscar has recently joined the Educational Program and Outreach of UCSD-based SDNI as Faculty Advisor.
					Oscar was also involved in other outreach initiatives to include the Indigenous Pipeline to UC Berkeley (2013-2014) and has been actively involved with the Bridges to Education at UC San Diego since 2016. Oscar is also Associate Editor in Micro- and Nanoelectromechanical Systems for the Journal “Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering”.

				Automotive catalysts, among others, and materials for dental implants could become more robust and easier to manufacture than ever before. This is because chemists have found a way to produce corundum (also known as alpha-alumina), a particularly stable variant of alumina, in the form of nanoparticles using simple mechanochemistry in a ball mill. The particles could be used, among other things, as a resistant carrier material in automotive catalysts or as a starting material for particularly hard ceramics. A first industrial company is already working on large-scale production of nanocorundum using the Mülheim process.

				Nanoplastics influence the behaviour of larval zebrafish, says new research by the Institute of Biology Leiden (IBL) and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML). The researchers observed that a certain type of nanoparticles leads to stress reactions in the sugar balance, resulting in hyperactivity in the fish larvae. The study was published on 18 October in Nature Communications Biology.

				(Nanowerk Spotlight) As flexible, wearable electronics move into the mainstream, the question of how to power these devices becomes a key issue. Connecting ultrathin, almost skin-like electronics and sensors with bulky, conventional batteries defeats the purpose. The ideal solution are self-powered devices that contain a built-in power generation capability that does not rely on external sources such as batteries or supercapacitors.

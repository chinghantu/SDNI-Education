				<p class="title"><b>The California NanoTech 2025 Project</b></p>
				<h5><br><br><b>The ultimate goal of the California NanoTech 2025 Project (the “Project”) is:</b></h5>
				<p>
					<br>
					(1) To ensure that quality nanotechnology contents is integrated to the K-12 NGSS-aligned current and future science curricula in every school district across California by year 2025.
					<br><br>
					(2) The Project intends to help California community colleges to establish general nanotechnology programs aligned with 4- years university programs for efficient transfer as well as technical education programs aiming to develop hands-on nanofabrication skills that the current and future job market demand.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>1. K-12 California Education System and NGSS-Aligned Science Curricula</h4>
				<p>
					<br>
					<b>Our outreach strategy consists of:</b>
					<br><br>
					Creating awareness about nanotechnology at all level of the education system, from administrators and science specialists of offices of education and school districts, school principals, teachers and TOSAs, and ultimately reach the students. This awareness will be realized via presentations, seminars, in-person meeting, web meetings, webinars to the parties to be reached. One of the great engagement tools that SDNI has used so far consists of remote access to its high-end Scanning Electron Microscope whereby students and teachers can remotely control SDNI SEM (with Focus and Zoom functions) and observe specimen at the micro and nano scale.
					<br><br>
					Creating nanotechnology contents that can be integrated to the current K-12 science curricula. Such contents is/will be distributed in the form of Open Educational Resources in electronic format for affordable and efficient distribution. This step in essential for a sustainable program aiming to make nanotechnology a part of the pre-college students’ education and a possible career choice.

				<h4>2. California Community College System</h4>
				<p>
					<br>
					<span style="color:#48457A"><b>(1) Diversity among colleges in regard to nanotechnology awareness.</b></span>
					<br><br>
					Some community colleges have nanotechnology classes and are well led by pioneers such as Jared Ashcroft at the Pasadena City College. However, most community colleges do not have such nanotechnology program and the majority of students attending these colleges do not know about nanotechnology or they heard about it as a buzz word only.
					<br><br>
					<span style="color:#48457A"><b>(2) Options: General Program or Technical Education.</b></span>
					<br><br>
					The authorization of new courses at community college is a lengthy process that takes approximately 2 years. Consequently, the establishment of standalone general nanotechnology program (in view of accredited transfer to a 4-year college) will take some time. However, the process should start now. We suggest starting the authorization process immediately based on 2 of the fundamental nano-engineering courses that are currently provided at UCSD and will be credited to any community college student desirous of transferring to UCSD. Upon successful enrollment and course completion, more classes can be added and eventually a full 2-year program can be established.
					<br><br>
					These programs can aim general education such as nanochemistry, nanoengineering and the like in view of <b>transferring to a 4-year university or technical education</b> such as nanofabrication leading directly to the marketplace.
					<br><br>
					<span style="color:#48457A"><b>(3) SDNI Outreach Strategy.</b></span>
					SDNI has established a partnership with Southwestern College (SWC) aiming to pilot the gradual development of a nanotechnology program at SWC. SDNI also intends to approach Miramar College, San Diego City College, and Mesa College located in the greater San Diego area and involve these 3 additional colleges in the pilot program. A successful implementation of pilot programs at these institutions, will pave the way to the implementation of nanotechnology programs across California based on lessons learned and success stories.
